1. Edit the path in file SmartClock.sh to point to the folder you built SmartClock into

2. Copy the file SmartClock.sh to /home/pi/SmartClock/build.
 
3. Edit SmartClock.desktop with the paths to your SmartClock build folder.  Copy SmartClock.desktop to /home/pi/.config/autostart folder.
   It might be different in your case. Just open your home folder and enable view hidden folders. open .config/autostart. If you don't see autostart folder, then create a folder called autostart within .config folder.
