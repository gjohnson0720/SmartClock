1. Create an empty file with extension .sh and name it whatever you want.

2. Copy the file SmartClock.sh to /home/pi/SmartClock/build.
 
3. Open /home/pi/.config/autostart folder. It might be different in your case. Just open your home folder and enable view hidden folders. open .config/autostart. If you don't see autostart folder, then create a folder called autostart within .config folder.  Copy SmartClock.desktop to this folder.
